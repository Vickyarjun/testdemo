 Objects:

              Objects are the representation of real-world entities in any language representing things by defining its properties along with their values.
                 In Javascript, objects may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs.

The syntax of creating object using object literal is given below:
object={key,value};

Internal representation in Javascript:

    Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 

These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).An object, is a reference data type. 

Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value.
