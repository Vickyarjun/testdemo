Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2;

-> HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1. 
-> HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection.
-> HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing. 
-> HTTP is a network delay sensitive protocol in the sense that if there is less network delay, then the page loads faster. 
-> HTTP/2 does not change much in terms of caching. 
-> Provides faster delivery of web pages and reduces web traffic as compared to HTTP/1.0. for every TCP connection there could be multiple requests and responses, and pipelining. 
-> Authentication used in HTTP1.1 is an improvement over HTTP1.0.
-> HTTPS uses SSL/TLS for secure encrypted communication.
